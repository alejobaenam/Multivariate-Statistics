# Multivariate Statistics

This repository provides resources and implementations for key techniques in multivariate statistical analysis. It is divided into three works, each focusing on a specific topic in multivariate statistics.

## Contents

### 1. **Multivariate Normality and Outlier Detection**
This section covers:
- **Normality Tests**: Generalized Shapiro-Wilk test and Mardia’s test for assessing multivariate normality.
- **Outlier Detection**: Techniques such as boxplots and Mahalanobis distance for identifying anomalies in multivariate datasets.

### 2. **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**
This section explores:
- The concept and methodology behind SVD.
- Applications of SVD for deriving principal components and creating biplots.
- Practical examples using software for dimensionality reduction and data visualization.

### 3. **Clustering and Linear Regression Analysis**
This section includes:
- **Clustering Techniques**: Hierarchical and non-hierarchical methods with practical examples.
- **Regression Analysis**: Focus on Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), including assumptions, tests, and interpretation.
- Practical guidelines for applying these techniques to real-world datasets.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/alejobaenam/multivariate-statistics.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the desired folder:
   ```bash
   cd Practice_1
   ```

Each work contains:
- **Code**: Implementations of algorithms and statistical methods.
- **Documentation**: Explanations and theoretical background.
- **Examples**: Practical applications and datasets for experimentation.
